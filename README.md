# ENEBOT-demo
A demo version of ENEBOT which served a combat flight simulation community since 2017. It uses Google Sheets api for user dictionary, Google Docs api for group flight scheduler, and jsoup for information crawling.
To be operated properly, requirements such as google credential files and bot tokens are needed. Some guild specific features were removed due to privacy reasons.
