# ENEBOT-demo
A demo version of ENEBOT which has served a combat flight simulation community since 2017. Possessing JDA as its backbone, it uses Google Sheets api for user dictionary, Google Docs api for group flight scheduler, and jsoup for information crawling.
To be operated properly, requirements such as google credential files and bot tokens are needed while having proper initial document files in google drive. Some guild specific features were removed due to privacy reasons.
